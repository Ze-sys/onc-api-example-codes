# onc-api-example-codes


 This repository is for code exampes for using Ocean Netwoks Canada's API service. The examples used Python 3, MATLAB and R languages. Each file name explains what the code in it does. For more visit the api documentation at  https://wiki.oceannetworks.ca/display/O2A/Oceans+2.0+API+Home. The goal of this repository is for sharing working code examples that use the most up todate api services ONC provides to a wider audince. We will update this examples reqularly. In order to download the latest codes, one can simply run the  notebook code_scrapper.ipynb or its .py version. They will download all code files in the current working directory. The directory structure will be:

```
└── scripts
    ├── MATLAB
    ├── Python3
    └── R
```
