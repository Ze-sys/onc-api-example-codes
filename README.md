# onc-api-example-codes


 This repository contains copies of code exampes shown at the Ocean Netwoks Canada's API service home page https://wiki.oceannetworks.ca/display/O2A/Oceans+2.0+API+Home. The examples use Python 3, MATLAB and R languages. Hopefully, each filename is descriptive enough and explains what the code in it does. For more visit the documentation on the above page. The goal of this repository is to share working code examples that use the most uptodate api services ONC provides. I will update the examples regularly. One can also simply run the notebook `code_scrapper.ipynb` or its .py version in this repository and get the latest examples. The code will download all the files in the current working directory with a structure shown below:

```
└── scripts
    ├── MATLAB
    ├── Python3
    └── R
```

This is a personal repository and the goal of the repository is to reach a wider community of users who may be interested in accessing ONC's data via the api services. Issues and dificulties while using any of the example codes or thier derivatives should be reported at https://jira.oceannetworks.ca/servicedesk/customer/user/login?destination=portals . The python and R versions may require installing a few packages to use them.
## TODO

 - Add example codes that use the api client libraries.
