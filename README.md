# onc-api-example-codes


 This repository is for copies of code exampes shown at the Ocean Netwoks Canada's API service home page https://wiki.oceannetworks.ca/display/O2A/Oceans+2.0+API+Home. The examples use Python 3, MATLAB and R languages. Hopefully, each filename is descriptive enough and explains what the code in it does. For more visit the documentation on the above page. The goal of this repository is to share working code examples that use the most uptodate api services ONC provides. I will update the examples regularly. One can also simply run the notebook `code_scrapper.ipynb` or its .py version in this repository and get the latest examples. The code will download all the files in the current working directory with a structure shown below:

```
└── scripts
    ├── MATLAB
    ├── Python3
    └── R
```

The goal of this repository is to reach a wider community of users of ONC data. Issues and dificulties using any of the example codes or thier derivatives should be reported at https://jira.oceannetworks.ca/servicedesk/customer/user/login?destination=portals    

## TODO

 - Add example codes that use the api client libraries.
